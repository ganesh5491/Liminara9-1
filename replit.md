# Recent Changes

## December 10, 2025 - Price Display Bug Fix
- Fixed critical price display bug where prices stored as comma-separated strings (e.g., "2,499") were causing NaN display and incorrect calculations
- Created `client/src/lib/priceUtils.ts` with three utility functions:
  - `parsePrice()`: Safely parses price strings with commas to numbers
  - `formatPrice()`: Formats numbers back to Indian numbering format
  - `formatCurrency()`: Formats as Indian Rupee currency (₹)
- Updated all components using price parsing: product-card, checkout, cart, cart-modal, address, product-detail, order-success, receipt-modal, payment-new, payment-cod, products, admin/products
- All price calculations now use `parsePrice()` instead of `parseFloat()` to correctly handle comma-separated values
